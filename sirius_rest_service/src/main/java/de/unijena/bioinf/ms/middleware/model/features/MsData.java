/**
 * The MsData wraps all spectral input data belonging to a (aligned) feature. All spectra fields are optional.
 * However, at least one Spectrum field needs to be set to create a valid MsData Object.
 * The different types of spectra fields can be extended to adapt to other MassSpec measurement techniques not covered yet.
 * <p>
 * Each Feature can have:
 * - One merged MS/MS spectrum (optional)
 * - One merged MS spectrum (optional)
 * - many MS/MS spectra (optional)
 * - many MS spectra (optional)
 * <p>
 * Each non-merged spectrum has an index which can be used to access the spectrum.
 * <p>
 * In the future we might add some additional information like chromatographic peak or something similar
