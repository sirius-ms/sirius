Untargeted metabolomics experiments usually relies on tandem mass spectrometry to identify the thousands of compounds in a biological sample. Today, the vast majority of metabolites remain unknown. Fragmentation trees have become a powerful tool for the interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry data of small molecules. These trees are found by combinatorial optimization, and aim at explaining the experimental data via fragmentation cascades. To obtain biochemically meaningful results requires an elaborate optimization function. We present a new scoring for computing fragmentation trees, transforming the combinatorial optimization into a maximum a~posteriori estimator. We demonstrate the superiority of the new scoring for two tasks\: Both for the de novo identification of molecular formulas of unknown compounds, and for searching a database for structurally similar compounds, our methods performs significantly better than the previous scoring, as well as other methods for this task. Our method can expedite the workflow for untargeted metabolomics, allowing researchers to investigate unknowns using automated computational methods.},\n} \n@Article{boecker09sirius,\nauthor \= {Sebastian B\\"ocker and Matthias Letzel and {\\relax Zs}uzsanna Lipt{\\'a}k and Anton Pervukhin},\ntitle \= {{SIRIUS}\: Decomposing isotope patterns for metabolite identification},\njournal \= {Bioinformatics},\nyear \= {2009},\nvolume \= {25},\nnumber \= {2},\npages \= {218--224},\nurl \= {http\://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/25/2/218},\ndoi \= {10.1093/bioinformatics/btn603},\npmid \= {19015140},\nabstract \= {Motivation\: High-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) is among the most widely used technologies in metabolomics. Metabolites participate in almost all cellular processes, but most metabolites still remain uncharacterized. Determination of the sum formula is a crucial step in the identification of an unknown metabolite, as it reduces its possible structures to a hopefully manageable set. Results\: We present a method for determining the sum formula of a metabolite solely from its mass and the natural distribution of its isotopes. Our input is a measured isotope pattern from a high resolution mass spectrometer, and we want to find those molecules that best match this pattern. Our method is computationally efficient, and results on experimental data are very promising\: For orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we correctly identify sum formulas for more than 90% of the molecules, ranging in mass up to 1000 Da.
