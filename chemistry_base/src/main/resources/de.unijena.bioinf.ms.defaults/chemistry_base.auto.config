# An adduct switch is a switch of the ionization mode within a spectrum, e.g. an ion replaces an sodium adduct

# analysis, but for certain adducts they might happen regularly. Adduct switches are written in the
# form  {@literal a -> b, a -> c, d -> c} where a, b, c, and d are adducts and  {@literal a -> b} denotes an allowed switch from
# a to b within the MS/MS spectrum.
